In this project we explore classification and regression applied to
the well-known Ising model. We show that the Ising model can be well
represented by linear regression methods like ordinary least squares,
Ridge, and LASSO (R2 score of 1.0 for all methods). 
Moving on the the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that
in classifying the states as either ordered or disordered, the logistic
regressor is mediocre at best (under 65\% correctly classified states).

Classifcation with both single- and multilayer perceptron is show to be very
successful in labling the input states, even for states in the critical
temperature region (up to 97\%)). Moreover, the neural network needs far 
less data for training than the logistic regressor for fitting.
