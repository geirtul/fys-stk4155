\section{Method}

\subsection{Producing data and recast problem}
To generate the training data, we used the code given in 
project2. 
The code a system with size \(L=40\) and \(1000\) different 
ising states and returns the Ising-energies. 

Then the problem was recasted as a linear regression model, using 
the regression methods from project1. The theory behind 
the Ising model and the recasting is described in ~\ref{seq:isingtheory}.

\subsection{Estimating the coupling constant of the one-dimensional Ising model using linear regression}

\subsection{Determining the phase of the 2D Ising model}
To determine the phase of the two dimensional Ising model we use 
logic regression. Information about logistic regression can be found 
in section \ref{seq:logistic}.
