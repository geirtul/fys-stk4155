\section{Introduction}
Code, data and figures are available at the following GitHub address:
\href{https://github.com/geirtul/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project2}{GitHub repository}\\
This project will follow closely the article of Metha et al, arXiv 1803.08823. 
The article is listed in references: \cite{HighBias}.

The main aim of the project is to study both classification and regression 
problems. The project will include three regression algorithms, 
logistic regression for classification problems and a multilayer 
perceptron code. The multilayer perceptron code is for studying both regression
and classification problems.

We will use the so-called Ising model for the training data, and also 
focus on supervised learning. 

As mentioned above we will look at both regression and classification problems.
Regression will be used to determine the value of the coupling constant
of the energy of the one-dimensional Ising model. 
The classification case will study the one dimensional Ising model in order to
classify the phase of the model. 

The various algorithms will be seen in comparison. In the end we will
summarize and give a critical evaluation of pros and cons. 
We will look at which algorithm works best for the regression case, 
and which works best for the classification case. \cite{Project2}
