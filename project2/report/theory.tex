\section{Theory}

%Consider putting in: general on ML 

%Consider adding theory from project1? 
%Until then: 
As the theory behond the three regression methods used as well as error 
estimates and the bootstrap method is covered in the previous 
project, we will not restate it here. 

\subsection{The 1D Ising model} 
The ising model is a simple binary value system where the variables
in the model can take only two values. For examle \(\pm 1\) or \(0\) and \(1\). 
~\cite{Project2} 

We will look at the physicist's approach, and call the variables for spin.
~\cite{Project2}

Given an ensamble of random spin configurations we can assign an energy to
each state, using the 1D Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions: 

\begin{equation}
	H = -J\sum\limits_{j=1}^N S_jS_{j+1} 
\end{equation}
J is the nearest-neighbor spin interaction, and \(S_j \epsilon {\pm 1}\) is a 
spin variable. N is the chain length. 
~\cite{HighBias}~\cite{Project2} 

In one dimension, this model has no phase transitions at finite temperature.
~\cite{Project2}
