\section{Introduction}
Code, data and figures are available at the following GitHub address:

In this project, we explore different ways to improve results of two binary
classifiers without hyperparameter tuning - Logistic regression and
Random forests. The methods used are of the over-sampling type and are as
follows: Random over-sampling, SMOTE, ADASYN, and balanced weighting of
inputs.

The data set chosen as input, is payment data The data set chosen is payment
data from an important bank in Taiwan, where the data describes credit card 
holders, and the goal is predicting whether a customer will default the 
next payment or not.

The same data set is used in an article from 2009 ~\cite{ComparisonData}
