\section{Introduction}
In this project, we explore different ways to improve results of two binary
classifiers without hyperparameter tuning - Logistic regression and
Random forests. The methods used are of the over-sampling type:
Random over-sampling, SMOTE, ADASYN, and balanced weighting of inputs.

The data set is provided by UCI and has also been the subject of study by \cite{ComparisonData}):

The report gives a brief introduction to the classifiers, and the methods
used to measure their performance.

Code, data and figures are available at the following GitHub address:
