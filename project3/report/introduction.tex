\section{Introduction}
Code, data and figures are available at the following GitHub address:
\href{https://github.com/geirtul/fys-stk4155/tree/master/project3}{GitHub repository}\\

In this project, we chose to use the credit card data set from UCI.
As we end up with a classification problem, we used logistic regression 
and decition trees and random forest algorithms. 

As the data set is used in an article, we have compared our results to 
some of the results in that article.
