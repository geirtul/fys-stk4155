\section{Introduction}
This report focuses on regression analysis and resampling methods. 
Three different regression methods will be combined with the bootsrap method 
and compared.
The regression models that will be looked at are the Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) method, Ridge regression and Lasso regression. 

The first thing we will study is how to fit polynomials of different order
to a spesific two-dimensional function called Franke's function. 
Thereafter the same methods will be used, trying to reproduce digital terrain
data.

The report is structured so that there is first given a bit of theory 
about the different methods, then we will present how we chose to implement 
those methods and why, before we show and discuss the results of using the 
different methods and finally makes a conclusion of what we think are 
each methods strong and weak sides. 
%TODO kanskje rydde opp litt i hva konklusjonen skal v√¶re?
