\section{Discussion}
The plot in figure \ref{fig:mse-complexity-abc} show the MSE declining with model complexity,
as would be expected for the Franke Function dataset, since it actually includes a polynomial
of degree 5.
As can be seen from the visualization in \ref{fig:comparison-e} this is indeed the case,
as the surface imitates that of the dataset quite well, but not perfectly.
For the real-world terrain data, the MSE follows a similar trend, shown in
figure \ref{fig:mse-complexity-e}.
