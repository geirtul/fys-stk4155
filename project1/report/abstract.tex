	This project looks at three different regression methods, Ordinary Least Squares, 
	Lasso and Ridge, used on a 
	known function together with the bootstrap resampling method. 
	It compares the three methods by looking at the Mean 
	Squared error and the \(R^2\) score.
	The results show that the OLS method performs the best when 
	trying to estimate Franke's function.
